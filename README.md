## Analysis of the impact of metro station location on commuter bikeshare habits
[Capital Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) makes its data available to download in quarterly files. For this analysis I downloaded every trip for the most recently available year (2015-Q4 through 2016-Q3). The metro station location data was obtained from the [WMATA API](https://developer.wmata.com/docs/services/) and the bike share station locations were obtained from the Capital Bikeshare station status [XML feed](https://feeds.capitalbikeshare.com/stations/stations.xml).

By considering both Capital Bikeshare and Metro station data sets together, we can assess how ridership, and ultimately membership, is affected by the location of metro stations under the assumption that many commuters use the two services in conjunction to get to and from work everyday. Through this analysis, we can hope to better understand the behavior of riders and therefore increase ridership through a targeted expansion of bike share coverage.

Throughout this analysis I used multiple python libraries â€“ namely pandas, pickle, matplotlib, scipy, geopy, and folium.

It is valuable to initially understand some of the larger trends in the bike share data. By splicing the data by day of the week, and then further by hour, we see that the weekday data has two large spikes associated with the morning and evening rush hour (centered on 8AM and 5PM).

By doing some quick comparisons of the slice sizes, we see that about 74% of rides occur during the work week and about 80% of those are from registered riders (those with a long term membership). 

Member or Day Type | Population
:---: | :---:
Casual | 628,777 
Registered | 2,520,541 
Weekday | 2,333,344 
Weekend | 815,974

## Considering location and distance

By merging the bike share location and bike share rider ship data, and using the `vincenty` function available in the `geopy` package, we can calculate the distance of each bike share station to each metro stations. We can then create flags for if a ride began, or terminated at a bike share station within 0.15 miles of a metro station.

We see that there is a spike right around 0.5 miles for rides concluding near metro stations during the morning rush or beginning during the evening rush. This spike is not present in rides in the opposite directions and not close in proximity to metro stations, and is therefore a strong indication that many commuters are using the bike sharing service to travel approximately half of a mile to the nearest metro station in the morning, and then away from the metro at night.

## Route popularity

We can support this observation by looking at the most popular routes during each time period both as tables and through mapping. By considering the 10 most popular routes during the morning rush, we can see that many of them began in Northeast DC and ended near the union station metro stop. Then, during the evening rush hour, the trend is reversed as all of the most popular trips originate near metro stations and many of them end in the Northeast region.  
Furthermore, T-tests comparing ridership in the morning vs. in the evening support the hypothesis that people are riding towards the metro in the morning and away from the metro at night (with 99% confidence).

This map shows all stations, both metro and bikeshare that were used in this analysis. Green flags indicate metro stations, red flags indicate bikeshare stations considered near metro stations, and blue flags bikeshare stations considered far. For this analysis 0.15 miles was used as the cutoff between near and far. Clicking on the image will load an interactive map that you can explore!
