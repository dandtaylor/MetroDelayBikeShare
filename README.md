## Analysis of the impact of metro station location on commuter bikeshare habits
[Capital Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) makes its data available to download in quarterly files. For this analysis I downloaded every trip for the most recently available year.

We see that approximately 80% of all rides are from registered users, and 74% occur during the work week.

Member Type | Population
:---: | :---:
Casual | 628,777 
Registered | 2,520,541 

<br>

We can further slice this data up into weekdays or weekends.
```python
bikeshare_weekday = bikeshare_rides[bikeshare_rides['Day'].str[0].isin(list('MTWF'))]
bikeshare_weekend = bikeshare_rides[~bikeshare_rides['Day'].str[0].isin(list('MTWF'))]
```

Using the `vincenty` function available in the `geopy` package, I then determined which of these stations are within 0.15 miles of a metro station.

This map shows all stations, both metro and bikeshare that were used in this analysis. Green flags indicate metro stations, red flags indicate bikeshare stations considered near metro stations, and blue flags bikeshare stations considered far. For this analysis 0.15 miles was used as the cutoff between near and far. Clicking on the image will load an interactive map that you can explore!
