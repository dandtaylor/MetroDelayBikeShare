This map shows all stations, both metro and bikeshare that were used in this analysis. Green flags indicate metro stations, red flags indicate bikeshare stations considered near metro stations, and blue flags bikeshare stations considered far. For this analysis 0.15 miles was used as the cutoff between near and far.
